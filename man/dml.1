.SH NAME
dml \- display Markdown (bold/italic) and LaTeX inline in the terminal via Kitty graphics protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dml
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] < \fIFILE\fR
.br
\fIsome_command\fR | \fBdml\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dml
reads text from standard input, processes it, and prints to standard output.
It renders:
.TP
\fBMarkdown\fR
  Basic Markdown styling:
  \*Bbold\*B (\fB**bold**\fR or \fB__bold__\fR) text.
  \*Iitalic\*I (\fI*italic*\fR or \fI_italic_\fR) text.
.TP
\fBLaTeX Math (as images)\fR
  Inline math snippets (\fI$formula$\\\fR).
  Display math blocks (\fI$$formula$$\\\fR).
  .LP
  In the default processing mode (without \\fB--render-all-latex\\fR), dml reads input line by line. It processes inline math (\\fI$formula$\\\\\\fR, \\fI\\(formula\\)\\\\\\fR) and single-line display math (\\fI$$formula$$\\\\\\fR, \\fI\\\\[formula\\\\]\\\\fR) on the fly. For multi-line display math blocks (starting with \\fI$$ \\\\fR or \\fI\\\\[ \\\\fR and ending with \\fI$$ \\\\fR or \\fI\\\\]\\\\fR), it buffers lines until the closing delimiter is found, then renders and outputs the entire block as a single image. Basic Markdown (bold/italic) is applied to text outside math blocks. This line-by-line processing with state-aware buffering for display math enables streaming output as content is generated by the source, which is useful when piping from incremental commands (e.g., LLMs).
  .LP
  Note: While multi-line display math is handled, other multi-line Markdown constructs (like code blocks, blockquotes, lists, tables) are not specially buffered and processed line by line. This may result in incorrect rendering or formatting for these elements in streaming mode. For reliable rendering of all multi-line structures and consistent LaTeX formatting for the entire document, use the \\fB--render-all-latex\\\\fR option.
  Rendered LaTeX images are displayed using the Kitty terminal graphics protocol.
Unrecognized Markdown syntax and other text are passed through as is. If math rendering fails (e.g., due to LaTeX errors), the original math text is displayed instead of an image and error details are printed to stderr.
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
If rendered LaTeX math doesn't appear correctly:
.TP
\fB1. Check Prerequisites\fR
Ensure \fBpdflatex\fR and \fBconvert\fR (ImageMagick) are properly installed and in your PATH.
.TP
\fB2. Terminal Compatibility\fR
Verify your terminal supports the Kitty graphics protocol. Not all terminals do.
.TP
\fB3. LaTeX Syntax\fR
Ensure your LaTeX math expressions are valid. Common errors include unmatched braces, missing package dependencies, or undefined commands.
.TP
\fB4. Examine Debug Output\fR
Run with \fB--debug\fR (or \fB-D\fR) to enable verbose logging. This will print detailed debug and error messages to stderr, which may help diagnose rendering problems. You can filter the output with \fB2>&1 | grep "^DEBUG\\|^ERROR"\fR.
.TP
\fB5. Try Full LaTeX Mode\fR
Use \fB--render-all-latex\fR for complex documents with many multi-line mathematical expressions.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--colour\fR \fICOLOR\fR
Set the text colour for rendered LaTeX images.
\fICOLOR\fR can be a named colour (e.g., "red", "blue") or a hex code (e.g., "#FF0000", "#0F0").
Defaults to "white".
.TP
\fB-c\fR \fICOLOR\fR
Short alias for \fB--colour\fR. If both are provided, \fB-c\fR takes precedence.
.TP
\fB--size\fR \fISIZE\fR
Set the target terminal row height for rendered LaTeX images.
\fISIZE\fR is an integer. A value of \fB0\fR (default) uses 1 row for inline math
and attempts to auto-size display math according to the terminal's perception
of the image's aspect ratio. Specific positive integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
request the image be scaled to that many terminal cell rows.
.TP
\fB-s\fR \fISIZE\fR
Short alias for \fB--size\fR. If both are provided, \fB-s\fR takes precedence.
.TP
\fB--dpi\fR \fIDPI_VALUE\fR
Set the DPI (dots per inch) for rendering LaTeX images.
\fIDPI_VALUE\fR is an integer. Defaults to \fB300\fR.
Higher values produce sharper images but may increase processing time and image size.
Use a value like \fB150\fR for lower resolution, or \fB600\fR for higher resolution.
.TP
\fB-d\fR \fIDPI_VALUE\fR
Short alias for \fB--dpi\fR. If both are provided, \fB-d\fR takes precedence. Higher DPI values produce clearer images but require more processing.
.TP
\fB--debug\fR
Enable verbose debug output. When enabled, detailed information about the rendering process will be printed to stderr, which can help diagnose problems with LaTeX math rendering or Kitty protocol generation.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Short alias for \fB--debug\fR.
.TP
\fB--render-all-latex\fR
Render the entire input (including Markdown formatting like bold/italic, and plain text)
as a single LaTeX document. This document is then compiled and displayed as one
continuous image using the Kitty graphics protocol.
This mode ensures consistent LaTeX font rendering for all content, but all text
becomes part of an image and is not selectable as terminal text.
Basic Markdown (bold, italic) and LaTeX math expressions within the input
are converted to their LaTeX equivalents.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
Short alias for \fB--render-all-latex\fR.
.TP
\fB--help\fR, \fB-h\fR
  (Note: Standard Go flag behavior; prints usage to stderr and exits.)
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
\fB0\fR
  Success.
.TP
\fB\>0\fR
  An error occurred (e.g., unable to render LaTeX, file issues).
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Display a file containing Markdown and LaTeX:
.RS
.B dml < my_document.md
.RE
.TP
Pipe output from another command:
.RS
.B echo '**Important:** $E=mc^2$' | dml --colour green
.RE
.TP
Render inline math at a specific height (e.g., 2 terminal rows):
.RS
.B echo 'An inline formula $x^2$ sized to 2 rows.' | dml -s 2
.RE
.TP
Render display math with a custom DPI (e.g., 150 DPI):
.RS
.B echo \'Display math at 150 DPI: $$ \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} $$\' | dml --dpi 150
.RE
.TP
Render an entire document (Markdown and text) as a single LaTeX image:
.RS
.B echo \'# Doc Title\\nSome **bold** and *italic* text, with math $E=mc^2$.\nThis will all be one image.\' | dml -l
.RE
.SH PREREQUISITES
.TP
\fBpdflatex\fR
  Required for compiling LaTeX. Part of TeX distributions (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
.TP
\fBconvert\fR
  Required for converting PDFs to PNGs. Part of ImageMagick.
.TP
\fBKitty Terminal (or compatible)\fR
  Required to display the rendered images, as dml uses the Kitty graphics protocol.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBKITTY_NO_GRAPHICS\fR
If set, disables the Kitty graphics protocol. Useful for debugging or when using non-Kitty terminals.
.TP
\fBDML_DEBUG\fR
Setting this to "1", "true", or "yes" enables debug output, equivalent to using the \fB--debug\fR flag. This is primarily used internally but can also be set manually to debug specific components.
